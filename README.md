Testing out Selenium

In order to run the project you first need to:

- Install NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/
- Install geckodriver and add `$PATH` variable if needed https://stackoverflow.com/a/56926716/3046537
- Navigate to `seleniumtests-master` directory
- Run `npm install` to grab dependencies from `package.json` (i.e. `selenium-webdriver`)
- Run `node index.js`


Read through `index.js`, the comments will let you know what is happening.
